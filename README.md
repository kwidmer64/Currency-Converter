# Currency Converter.
## by nokompass

### About the project:

This project was a way for me to sharpen my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills. I followed a [tutorial by Jonah Lawrence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZNG8UomjSI)
on how to build a simple weather app. Instead of creating a weather app, I created a currency converter so I couldn't directly copy the logic.
